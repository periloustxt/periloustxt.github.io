    <code>7kb</code><br><br>
    Welcome to my corner of the web. Everything is 
    coded to be very efficient: HTML, very little 
    CSS, and very small image files.
    <br><br>
    I'm hoping to use this space to think about political 
    theory, technological liberalism, frugal computing,
    digital safe spaces, mutual-aid, decolonial futures, 
    speculative fiction, Asian identity-making, audio 
    engineering, punk music, sonic regimes of power, 
    and random streams of consciousness.
    <br><br>
    I do welcome feedback! I'm using this space 
    anonymously, but you can email me if you want 
    to build some connections, have a discourse, or 
    just say what's up!
