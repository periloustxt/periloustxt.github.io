<a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.codeberg.page/articles/frugal-computing/">Frugal Computing:</a> The current emissions from computing are about 2% of the world total but are projected to rise steeply over the next two decades. By 2040 emissions from computing alone will be more than of half the emissions level acceptable to keep global warming below 1.5°C. This growth in computing emissions is unsustainable: it would make it virtually impossible to meet the emissions warming limit.
<br /><br />
Therefore we must extend the useful life of our computing devices.

<a href="https://zine.yesterweb.org/issue-00/index.php?page=2">The Internet and Capitalism: </a>The 'old web' we affectionately refer to is a web that didn't put profit first - because no one had figured out how to yet. When the internet first came into popular use, the biggest businesses hadn't yet found a significant way to capitalize on it.
<br/><br/><hr><br/><br/>

<a href="https://yesterweb.org/#summary">Reclaiming The Internet:</a> Nostalgia for the old web was not just limited to people that had experienced the old web. Surprisingly, there were many children and young adults that felt anemoia, or nostalgia for a place or time they have never been. It is clear that this was a response to the deterioration of the core web that these young people had grown up in. What isn't clear is whether this reaction is a longing for the old web and its aesthetics or if it reflects a deeper desire for change that is partially reflected by the positive aspects of the old web.

<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/web-developer-tara-vancil-on-exploring-how-to-be-online-in-radical-ways/">On exploring how to be online in radical ways:</a> I like to call the web humanity’s shared language. We’ve all come together, by some miracle, as a society to define a set of rules and technical standards about how we will communicate, how our computers will communicate with each other, and people all over the world use this. I mean, that’s pretty miraculous that we’ve managed to do that. So why shouldn’t everybody be able to build stuff on it, and share things on it? It seems really sad that right now that’s not the case, and I think it’s also boring.

<a href="https://sadgrl.online/cyberspace/internet-manifesto">sadgirl.online:</a> I've since learned that there's more we can do to transform the internet that goes far beyond the act of creating a website, so I wanted to update this page with new information.
<br/><br/>
For example, we can work on transforming social relations online. This is something that anyone can participate in, with a little effort. Social relations online (especially on social media) tend to be divisive and hostile. It's easy to forget that there are real people on the other side of the screen.

<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/13/this-is-for-everyone/">The (open) web is good, actually:</a> But the current enthusiasm for virtual worlds isn't merely a function of the interesting, cool and fun experiences you can have in them. Rather, it's a bid to kill off whatever is left of the old, good web and put everything inside a walled garden. Facebook's metaverse "is more of the same but with a technical footprint so expensive and so demanding that it all but ensures it will only be within the means of a very few companies to operate."

<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/18/collectanea/#bricabrac">The sleaze of the prison-tech system is the worst imaginable</a> – which is about what you'd expect. After all, prison-tech is at the very foot of the shitty technology adoption curve.

<a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-bandcamp-as-we-know-it-over/">Is Bandcamp as We Know It Over?:</a> Bandcamp is so central to the business of independent music that it’s tempting to see it as too big to fail, yet its failure is a real possibility. “Nationalize Bandcamp” is a Twitter meme, not a political program; not even Bandcamp’s union was able to help save employees from this round of layoffs. And if Songtradr did implode—or, perhaps worse, strip Bandcamp for parts and discard the rest—the consequences could be catastrophic for independent music.

<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-build-the-future-music-industry-we-want-and-need/">How to build the future music industry we want and need:</a> Music is older than capitalism. There’s a familiar narrative in the music industry involving a few megalithic gatekeepers, and an army of content-producing ants struggling to collect the crumbs they cast off. This is a story of capitalism, and it’s accurate enough. But it isn’t the only way to understand the world we work and play within.
