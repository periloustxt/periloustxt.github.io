<h2>tool kit</h2>

<a href="https://libgen.is/">libgen.is</a><br>
I simply cannot exist without this online library of pirated books. Find almost anything here.<br><br>

<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/">The Anarchist Library</a><br>
One of my favorite libraries online. Tons of subject categories. Lots of great leftist readings.</a><br><br>

<a href="https://textz.com/">textz</a><br>
A list of wonderful reads related to political futures, art, and technology. View the source code for secret links!<br><br>

<a href="http://68k.news/">68k.news</a><br>
Lo-fi HTML feed of popular news headlines. Loads fast, uses little data. Read articles without web bloat.<br><br>

<a href="https://raindrop.io">Raindrop</a><br>
Very handy web bookmarker/read later service. Browser extension available. Hashtagging, folder organizing, and highlighting of web content included. This has been one of my favorite recent web apps.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">inoreader</a><br>
Since the downfall of Google Reader, there have been few options outside of Feedly for an adequate online RSS reader. Inoreader has a very good, minimalist and customizable interface. I love the plain list view.<br><br>

<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange Gemini Client</a><br>
A very good Gemini protocol browser. Access the Gemini small web.<br><br>

<a href="https://app.simplenote.com/">SimpleNote</a><br>
Still a great online note taking service. I use it for quick notes to sync from my phone to my web browsers. From there, I transfer notes over to my Obsidian vault.<br><br>

<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a><br>
I've tried Logseq, but like Obsidian more. Faster, better file organization, and my vault keeps all my notes and PDF's organized there.<br><br>

<a href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a><br>
Humming along in the background of both my MacOS laptop and my old iMac running Linux Mint XFCE is the very powerful folder synchronization tool SyncThing. I have one folder that houses my Obsidian vault, making it accessible from both computers across different operating systems.<br><br>

<a href="https://vscodium.com/">VS Codium</a><br>
Open source binaries of VS Code, without the Microsoft telemetry. Pretty much the same experience as VS Code, but faster, more private.<br><br>

<a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/">Marginalia Search</a><br>
I love this search engine for parsing out otherwise unseen corners of the web. A great alternative to your regular cast of Google, DuckDuckGo, or Bing.<br><br>

<a href="https://webwormhole.io/">webwormhole</a><br>
Send large files through a web wormhole. Both users must be online at the same time. Unique code word generated for each transfer.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.powerthesaurus.org/">Power Thesaurus</a><br>
A better thesaurus.<br><br>

<a href="https://app.addy.io/">addy.io</a><br>
Make an anonymous e-mail alias and keep spam under control.</a><br><br>

<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a><br>
Your complete Microsoft Suite replacement. Word documents, spreadsheets, presentations, everything you'd need. I especially love customizing all the toolbars to make each application a lot less cluttered than Microsoft Word or Apple Pages.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=307">Linux Mint XFCE</a><br>
I had a very slow-running 2015 iMac that was given a new life with Linux Mint XFCE. Runs very fast on old hardware. I'm convinced I'll never need a Windows or MacOS machine again except maybe to run Logic Pro.<br><br>
